# To Do 

This is an orphan branch of a repository for all the tasks assigned to me under the internship of [Digital Empowerment Pakistan](https://digitalempowermentpakistan.com/) aka DEP.
It was a requirement of the internship that I make a GitHub repository by the name 'DEP' and push all my completed tasks to it.
So, I have made this branch for the task 1 of the internship.

## To Do List Android App

I was tasked with creating the application as:

### Objective:

Create an app that allows users to manage their
daily tasks.

### Key Steps:

1. Design the app's UI with screens for task creation,
   viewing, and editing.
2. Implement a local database (e.g., Sqflite) to store tasks.
3. Enable CRUD operations for tasks.
4. Add features like task categorization, due dates, and
   reminders.
5. Test the app thoroughly to ensure all features work as
   expected.

### Stack:

1. Flutter/Dart
2. Sqflite Local Database
