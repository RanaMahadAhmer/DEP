# Weather App

This is an orphan branch of a repository for all the tasks assigned to me under the internship of [Digital Empowerment Pakistan](https://digitalempowermentpakistan.com/) aka DEP.
It was a requirement of the internship that I make a GitHub repository by the name 'DEP' and push all my completed tasks to it.
So, I have made this branch for the task 2 of the internship.

## Native Android Weather App

I was tasked with creating the application as:

### Objective:

Develop an app that provides current weather information and
forecasts.

### Key Steps:

1. Design the app's UI with screens for current weather and forecasts.
2. Integrate a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch weather data.
3. Implement data parsing and display the fetched information.
4. Add features like location search and weather alerts.
5. Test the app to ensure accurate data display and functionality.

### Stack:

1. Kotlin
2. XML
