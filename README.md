# Digital Empowerment Pakistan's Android App Internship

This is a repository for all the tasks assigned to me under the internship of [Digital Empowerment Pakistan](https://digitalempowermentpakistan.com/) aka DEP.
It was a requirement of the internship that I make a GitHub repository by the name 'DEP' and push all my completed tasks to it.
So, I have made this repository and all the individual tasks are organized as the orphan branches of this 'DEP' repository.
