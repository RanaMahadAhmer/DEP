# Digital Empowerment Pakistan's Android App Internship

This is a repositry for all the tasks assigned to me under the internship of [Digital Empowerment Pakistan](https://digitalempowermentpakistan.com/) aka DEP.

It was a requirement of the internship that I make a GitHub repositry by the name 'DEP' and push all my completed tasks to it.

So, I have made this repositry and all the individual tasks are organized as the orphan branches of this 'DEP' repositry.

## Tasks

#### Objective:
Create an app that allows users to manage their
daily tasks.

reminders.
4. Test the app thoroughly to ensure all features work as
expected.
