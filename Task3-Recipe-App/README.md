# Recipe Radar

This is an orphan branch of a repository for all the tasks assigned to me under the internship of [Digital Empowerment Pakistan](https://digitalempowermentpakistan.com/) aka DEP.
It was a requirement of the internship that I make a GitHub repository by the name 'DEP' and push all my completed tasks to it.
So, I have made this branch for the task 3 of the internship.

## Recipe Native Android App

I was tasked with creating the application as:

### Objective:

Create an app that allows users to
browse, search, and save recipes.

### Key Steps:


1. Design the app's UI with screens for recipe browsing, details, and favorites.
2. Implement a local database to store favorite recipes.
3. Integrate a recipe API (e.g., Spoonacular) to fetch recipe data.
4. Implement search functionality and filters.Test the app to ensure smooth navigation and data accuracy.

### Stack:

1. Kotlin
2. Jetpack Compose
3. Spoonacular API (for recipe data)
4. Room Library (for Persistence)
